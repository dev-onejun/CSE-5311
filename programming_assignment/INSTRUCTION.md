# Instruction

## Summary

+ Due Date: Nov. 10th
+ Any programming languages are fine
+ TA Demo: A spreadsheet will be given. Assign your schedule in the spreadsheet to demo your program to TA.

- Goal: compare the algorithms. In a report, the professor wants to see a graph figure of each algorithms for how much time they take to run.

- Packages and Libraries, of course, are not allowed.

## Details

**Programming Project**



Due Date: 11/10/ 2024 11:59:00 PM

Several programming projects are briefly described below. Project should be done individually.  Each student should choose  one project from the following 4 possible projects and should submit a project report and do a demo to the TA. For example if you choose project 1, you need to implement all 6 sorting algorithms mentioned in the description of the question.



**Final Project Demonstration:**

The project presentation will be scheduled between  December 02 - 06, 2024 and the TA will set up a meeting for each student.  You will receive an email from TA so make sure that you schedule a time to demo your work otherwise you will miss half of the project points. During the presentation, you will demonstrate your project to the TA in which you show the various features of your system, such as its correctness, efficiency, etc. You should be prepared to answer detailed questions on the system design and implementation during this demo. We will also examine your code to check for code quality, code documentation, etc.  Plagiarism will be treated very seriously, we will also use some popular academic tools to check for plagiarism that can look past simple variable name changes, moving code blocks etc :). Additional details will be communicated as necessary.



**Project has 15% weight of the final grade:**

File submission: 50 Points
Demo to TA: 50 Points (In person)
100 Points Total


**Deliverables:**

The following are the expected project deliverables that must be in Canvas. Please zip your folder containing all your files before submitting to Canvas.

A completed project report  which contains details about your project, such as main data structures, main components of the algorithm (different functions and what they do), design of the user-interface (if applicable, GUI is not required), experimental results, e.g. charts of running time versus input size, etc.
You should also turn in your code and associated documentation (e.g. README files) so that everything can be backed up for future reference
Your inputs (graphs, trees or arrays) should also be included (Do not hard code inputs). You can also use random generators to make inputs for sorting algorithms.


Implement and compare the following algorithms. How their running times change with respect to data size? How their speed compare to each other in the cases with different data size? Can you improve their running time with your discovery? Which one is better in terms what conditions?



**1. Project 1 (Sorting Algorithms)**

Implement and compare the following sorting algorithm : \
● Mergesort \
● Heapsort \
● Quicksort (Regular quick sort* and quick sort using 3 medians) \
● Insertion sort \
● Selection sort \
● Bubble sort

● For regular quick sort you can decide between choosing first, last or a random element as pivot. But you need to include both regular and 3 medians as separate algorithms.



**2. Project 2 (Search Algorithms)**

Implement and compare the following search algorithm: \
● Linear search \
● Binary search in sorted array. \
● Binary search tree \
● Red-Black Tree




**3. Project 3 (Shortest Path)**

Implement and compare the following shortest paths algorithm for weighted graph and unweighted graph: \
● Breadth-first search (unweighted graph) \
● The Bellman-Ford algorithm \
● Dijkstra’s algorithm




**4. Project 4 (Minimum Spanning Tree)**

Implement and compare the following Minimum Spanning Trees algorithms: \
● Kruskal algorithm \
● Prim algorithm



**You can use any programming language that you  are most comfortable with but you can not use any packages (for main algorithms asked)  and you need to implement each algorithm from scratch.**



**Bonus (10 points): Implement a GUI for your program which allows the user to:**

Select an algorithm \
Enter the input size for selected algorithms and see the run time (in seconds or milliseconds...) \
Compare two or more (For the 4th project, maximum is 2) algorithms and see the difference in running times (in seconds or milliseconds...).
