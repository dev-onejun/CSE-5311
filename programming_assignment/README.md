***Abstract*** \
Among 4 types of given candidate projects, this project implemented 4th project, Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms which are Kruskal algorithm and Prim algorithm.
\cdots
Although the project initially used AA, BB increased the efficiency? CC.
As a result, the project optimized the DD algorithm to EE.
